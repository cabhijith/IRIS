# IRIS 2020
## A novel, multi-model, data first, chrome extension and WhatsApp based approach to fake news

This is a repoistory storing the weights and scripts to <b>reproduce</b> the results presented at IRIS 2020. 
The results achieved and the methadologies used can be found at ```Final_Data_Book.pdf```
To reproduce the results, please follow the instructions below. 

### Contents:
1) Weights
2) Scripts
3) RealNet dataset
4) Data book


1 - <b>Download the SNLI and MultiNLI datasets from the two corresponding links:</b>

https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/

http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/

2 - <b>Download and extract a set of features used as input to the model</b>: https://mega.nz/#!08IyyKrT!rfsor4KQSPX0OCBAMhIzqhfOLkRZQBAN5BqqiIJXdrA

3 - <b>Download the features generated from here</b>: https://mega.nz/#!tlAG3abL!hoPZhr7X5M1ifuPaXSAaNExuAz8DdEHHdV3EC5PSojE

4 - <b>Next download the weights for the two models</b>: 

   Linguistics model - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-symK6E-LRN_SW2Gnr0Z0xraA6FW0vC4
   
   Stance Detection model - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-dYTRCO59vIjOMEaZYzhjbngxFvo-jsK

5 - <b>Finally, run the code in ```Combined.ipynb```</b>. 

Use the ```RealNet``` dataset to test and benchmark the results.
